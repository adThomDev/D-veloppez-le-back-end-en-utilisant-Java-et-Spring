## Description
This project is a Spring Boot backend for a properties rental portal application, complementing an existing Angular frontend.

It will handle user authentication, secure requests using Json Web Tokens, manage some CRUD operations on rentals, users and messages, and provide an API documentation with Swagger.

## Technology
 - Java language
 - Spring Boot framework
 - Swagger for API documentation
 - MySQL database

## Documentation
You'll find in the "docs" folder at the root of the project the following files :
 - An SQL script for database initialization
 - A Postman collection for API testing

## Features
- User Authentication: Users (tenants or property owners) must authenticate to access the application beside the login page.
  You can find in the sql scripts a command to create an user with login "user1@ocrp3.com" and password is "ocrpassword1"
- Documentation : The API is documented with Swagger, you can access it at this address :
  http://localhost:3001/swagger-ui/index.html

cd p3back
```

Run the application:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be available at :
http://localhost:3001
You can change the server port in the application.properties file, modifiying the line "server.port=3001".

### Database configuration
You can find the database configuration in the application.properties file, where for example you'll be able to change its server name and port and the login/password to access it.

### Database Initialization
